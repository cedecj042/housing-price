# Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a linear regression approach to predict housing prices using Python. The analysis and model development are documented in the `linear-regression.ipynb` notebook.

## What it does
- Implements gradient descent optimization
- Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) as cost function
- Includes feature selection via correlation and mutual information
- Evaluates model using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²
- Compares top features using different selection strategies

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction/)
- The dataset contains various features related to houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, and price.

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Open and run the `linear-regression.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
| Feature Selection | RÂ² | RMSE |
|-------------------|----|------|
| Correlation (Top 10) | 0.681 | â‚±989k |
| Mutual Information (Top 10) | 0.671 | â‚±1.00M |
